# 🚖 Uber vs Lyft: Ride Data Analysis & Modeling

This repository contains an in-depth data science project comparing Uber and Lyft ride pricing patterns, behaviors, and trends using data-driven methods.

---

## 📊 Overview

This project explores:
- Ride trends by hour, date, and weather
- Price variations across distance, time, and traffic conditions
- Sentiment classification based on weather conditions
- Surge multiplier impact
- Geospatial pickup/dropoff patterns
- Two ML models to predict **price per mile**

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, pipelines, evaluation
- **APIs**: OpenCage Geocoder
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, barplots, scatterplots, Folium maps
- **Data size**: 600,000+ rows (cleaned & modeled)
